The player takes control of the three and solves puzzles while using time travel to explore different periods of history. 
 
Dave Grossman and Tim Schafer co-led the game\'s development, their first time in such a role. The pair carried over a limited amount of elements from Maniac Mansion and forwent the character selection aspect to simplify development. Inspirations included Chuck Jones cartoons and the history of the United States. Day of the Tentacle is the eighth LucasArts title to use the SCUMM engine, and the company\'s first title to feature voice acting. 
 
The game was released simultaneously on floppy disk and CD-ROM to critical acclaim and commercial success. Critics focused on its cartoon-style visuals and comedic elements.

Whether you\'re surfing on a ray across an ocean in the clouds, rolling on a ball through a treacherous garden, or floating in a bubble over a poisonous swamp, there\'s no limit to the cosmic challenges you\'ll encounter! 
 
* Shake it! Controlling Mario is as simple as can be with the Wii Remote and Nunchuk. Move Mario with the Control Stick and shake the Wii Remote to perform a spin move or cue Ring Stars that launch you to and from planetary objects. You can even point at bits of stardust to collect them or latch onto Beam Stars to blaze a magnetic trail through the heavens. 
 
* Mario can run, tiptoe, jump, triple-jump, backflip, and long-jump, but what he\'ll do most is spin. By shaking the Wii Remote, players make Mario spin around with fists outstretched, allowing him to pummel enemies and cue Star Rings that launch him from planet to planet. 
 
* He can also find plenty of power-ups: A Bee Mushroom turns him into Bee Mario, allowing him to fly for short periods of time and cling to honeycombs. A Boo Mushroom turns him into Boo Mario, allowing him to float and turn invisible to pass through mesh gates. 
 
* He\'ll constantly collect bits of stardust. These can be fired at enemies using the B Button. A second player can even take on this role, using a second Wii Remote to stall enemies, fire stardust, or even sweep aside projectiles.',

'Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 4', 
'2008-07-10 00:00:00', 
'Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 4 is the fourth main entry of the Persona series. Which is a spin off series of the Shin Megami Tensei series. Starting with Persona 3, the series became popular for its combination of traditional RPG mechanics, and social simulation gameplay. By day the player attends high school. By night the game becomes a dungeon crawling turn based RPG. In Persona 4 the player assumes the role of the player-named protagonist who has transferred to a new school in the fictional rural Japanese town of Inaba. The protagonist gains the ability to summon Personas, a power that allows the protagonist to fight Shadows, the enemies of the game. 
 
Like Persona 3, Persona 4 requires the player to manage their time wisely. As most actions in the game will result in time advancing. Passage of time is not based on how long the player takes to do their actions. Once the player has chosen what they will do, time will pass. When time passes it simply skips to the next part of the day. Each day is split into multiple parts: Early Morning, Morning, Lunch, Daytime, Afternoon, After School, and the Evening. Players can choose to spend time with friends, study, read books, fish, and many other side activities. Note that shopping does not cause time to pass. 
 
On schooldays the player attends school, where there is usually a lecture about random factoids of real life that you will be quizzed on. Getting these questions right or wrong does not effect the main story, but raises the characters Knowledge social stat, which can be used to unlock dialogue options in some cutscenes, and get higher test scores. Other social stats, include: Understanding, Courage, Expression, and Diligence. Each of these stats have many various effects on the players side activities. Some social links require certain levels of social stats. Increasing your social stats can unlock more part time jobs for the player to earn more money. After school and on weekends the player chooses what to do with their free time, 
 
At night, the player can traverse dungeons. Where they will fight many different types of Shadows. The combat is very similar to any traditional turn based Japanese RPG game. Persona 4 uses a combat system akin to the Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne "Press Turn" system. In which the player can take advantage of the enemies weaknesses to gain extra turns. If the player attacks an enemy with an element that enemy is weak to, the player gains an extra turn to attack. However, repeating that attack on the same enemy will not give the character a second extra turn. 
 
The game features a very complex but easy to use fusing system. The player selects multiple personas to fuse together to create a new persona that can sometimes carry over some of the base personas skills. Later into the game the player can unlock Special Fusions to create Peronas that are very powerful. 
 
Social Links are one of the key mechanics in this game. Social Links are a measure of the friendship between the protagonist and the many characters of Persona 4. This feature gives your fused Personas bonus experience upon their creation, and allow you to learn new skills and abilities in battle. Social Links also open up romantic relationship options with a few of the games female characters. Social Links play out as the normal cutscenes in the game that provide more character development for the huge cast of characters. There are 24 Social Links in total, each one has a respective Arcana. All Personas have an assigned Arcana. Having a Persona of the same Arcana of a Social Link doubles the rate that you level that Social Link. 
 
Persona 4\'s plot is closely tied to the weather, thus the player can check the ingame weather forecast. Weather has various effects on the game, on rainy days if the player chooses to study they will gain more Knowledge points than normal. The most essential part of the weather forecast is recognizing when the town will become foggy, as this is an indication of when the player must finish the dungeon they are currently exploring. If the player fails to complete a dungeon before a foggy day the game rolls the calender back one week. The fog sets in after 2 or more rainy days.',

While the games feature several expansions in key areas, the overall plot follows the same direction as the original Gold and Silver. Some aspects exclusive to Crystal are also included. Like how FireRed and LeafGreen could link up with Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald to complete the Pokédex by trading regionally exclusive Pokémon, HeartGold and SoulSilver can link up with Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum to obtain Pokémon unavailable in Johto and Kanto (such as the Sinnoh starters) and vice versa. 
Kris, despite being the female counterpart of Crystal\'s player character, is not included as the female player character, with a new character instead taking her place. Whether she is chosen to be the player character or not, this new character will still appear in the game. The unselected protagonist will take a pseudo-rival role similar to the unselected characters of Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum.

'Ico', 
'2001-09-24 00:00:00', 
'Ico (イコ Iko?, /ˈiːkoʊ/) is an action-adventure game developed by Team Ico and published by Sony Computer Entertainment, released for the PlayStation 2 video game console in 2001 and 2002 across various regions. It was designed and directed by Fumito Ueda, who wanted to create a minimalist game around a "boy meets girl" concept. Originally planned for the PlayStation, Ico took approximately four years to develop. The team employed a "subtracting design" approach to reduce elements of gameplay that interfered with the game\'s setting and story in order to create a high level of immersion.

The protagonist is a young boy named Ico who was born with horns, which his village considers a bad omen. Warriors lock him away in an abandoned fortress. During his explorations of the fortress, Ico encounters Yorda, the daughter of the castle\'s Queen. The Queen plans to use Yorda\'s body to extend her own lifespan. Learning this, Ico seeks to escape the castle with Yorda, keeping her safe from the shadow-like creatures that attempt to draw her back. Throughout the game, the player controls Ico as he explores the castle, solves puzzles and assists Yorda across obstacles.

Ico introduced several design and technical elements, including a story told with minimal dialog, bloom lighting and key frame animation, that have influenced subsequent games. Although not a commercial success, it was critically acclaimed for its art and story elements and received several awards, including "Game of the Year" nominations and three Game Developers Choice Awards. Ico is listed on several overall top game lists, and is often considered a work of art. The game was reprinted in Europe in 2006, in conjunction with the release of Shadow of the Colossus, the spiritual successor to Ico. Along with Shadow of the Colossus, Ico was released in The Ico & Shadow of the Colossus Collection for the PlayStation 3 which featured high-definition graphics and 3D support. This HD version was released separately as a retail version in Japan.',

'In Journey the player controls a robed figure in a vast desert, traveling towards a mountain in the distance. Other players on the same journey can be discovered, and two players can meet and assist each other, but they cannot communicate via speech or text and cannot see each other\'s names. The only form of communication between the two is a musical chime. This chime also transforms dull, stiff pieces of cloth found throughout the levels into vibrant red, affecting the game world and allowing the player to progress through the levels. The robed figure wears a trailing scarf, which when charged by approaching floating pieces of cloth, briefly allows the player to float through the air.

The developers sought to evoke in the player a sense of smallness and wonder, and to forge an emotional connection between them and the anonymous players they meet along the way. The music, composed by Austin Wintory, dynamically responds to the player\'s actions, building a single theme to represent the game\'s emotional arc throughout the story. Reviewers of the game praised the visual and auditory art as well as the sense of companionship created by playing with a stranger, calling it a moving and emotional experience. Journey won several "game of the year" awards and received several other awards and nominations, including a Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media nomination for the 2013 Grammy Awards.',

'1997-03-22 00:00:00', 
'Tekken 3 maintains the same core fighting system and concept as its predecessors, but brings many improvements, such as significantly more detailed graphics and animations, fifteen new characters added to the game\'s roster, more modern music and faster and more fluid gameplay. 
Perhaps the most noticeable change from Tekken 2 fight system is movement reform - whereas the element of depth had been largely insignificant in previous Tekken games (aside from some characters having unique sidesteps and dodging maneuvers), Tekken 3 added emphasis on the third axis, allowing all characters to sidestep in or out of the background by lightly pressing the arcade stick (or tapping the controller button in the console version) towards the corresponding direction. Another big change in movement was that jumping was toned down, no longer allowing fighters to jump to extreme heights (as was present in previous games), but keeping leaps to reasonable, realistic heights. It made air combat more controllable, and put more use to sidestep dodges, as jumping no longer became a universal dodge move that was flying above all of the ground moves. Other than that, the improved engine allowed for quick recoveries from knock-downs, more escapes from tackles and stuns, better juggling (as many old moves had changed parameters, allowing them to connect in combo-situations, where they wouldn\'t connect in previous games) and extra newly created combo throws. 
 
Tekken 3 was the first Tekken to feature a beat \'em up minigame called "Tekken Force", which pitted the player in various stages against enemies in a side-scrolling fashion. If the player succeeds in beating the minigame four times, Dr. Bosconovitch would be a playable character (granted that you defeat him first). This was continued in Tekken 4 and succeeded by the Devil Within minigame in Tekken 5 - but Boskonovitch was dropped as a playable character after Tekken 3. There is also a minigame "Tekken Ball", similar to beach volleyball, where one has to hit the ball with a powerful attack to hurt the opponent or try to hit the ball in such a way that it hits the ground in the opponent\'s area, thus causing damage.',

Much of the gameplay takes place on foot, but also includes segments focused on vehicular combat. The balance of weapons and objects in the game was adjusted to better adhere to the "Golden Triangle of Halo": these are weapons, grenades, and melee attacks, which are available to a player in most situations. Players may dual-wield some weapons, forgoing the use of grenades and melee attacks in favor of the combined firepower of two weapons. Many weapons available in previous installments of the series return with minor cosmetic and power alterations. Unlike previous installments, the player\'s secondary weapon is visible on their player model, holstered or slung across the player\'s back. 
Halo 3 introduces "support weapons", which are cumbersome two-handed weapons that slow the player, but offer greatly increased firepower in return. In addition to weapons, the game contains a new class of gear called equipment; these items have various effects, ranging from defensive screens to shield regeneration and flares. Only one piece of equipment can be carried at a time. The game\'s vehicular component has been expanded with new drivable and AI-only vehicles.',

The gameplay by default is first person, but players have the option to play in third person mode. The core gameplay revolves around breaking and placing blocks. The game world is essentially composed of rough 3D objects—mainly cubes—that are arranged in a fixed grid pattern and represent different materials, such as dirt, stone, various ores, water, and tree trunks. While players can move freely across the world, objects and items can only be placed at fixed locations relative to the grid. Players can gather these material blocks and place them elsewhere, thus allowing for various constructions.',

While players can only explore with four heroes, they will be able to recruit and manage around a dozen heroes from the local tavern or caravan. The heroes are recruited from 15 different classes each class with its own unique skills and abilities. 
 
Combat occurs in narrow passages which means the party\'s order is important in respect to the heroes\' class and the player\'s strategy. As an example, a crusader is a good front unit having both high attack and defense values while the plague doctor might be better further behind throwing plague bombs to spread disease and confusion. 
 
Instead of leveling, heroes have "resolve" which will increase as they adventure. Fighting and events will test the hero\'s resolve and they might develop afflictions if they fail their resolve. This can turn out both positively and negatively creating different set of afflictions for every hero. 
 
While exploring the dungeons, the light of the heroes torch becomes dimmer, which means the dungeons gets more dangerous but yields better loot as well. The heroes have to camp to replenish the torch in the dungeons. Red Hook refers to this as tactical camping because players have to distribute rations among their heroes, protect the camp from ambushes, and reduce the stress levels of the heroes, all costing actions points',

'Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is a third-person puzzle-platformer and action-adventure computer and video game published by Ubisoft. It was released on November 21, 2003 and is a reboot of the landmark video game series Prince of Persia, created by Jordan Mechner in 1989. 
 
The Sands of Time, developed internally at Ubisoft Montreal, successfully captures the mechanics of the original platformer and extends it to the 3D generation. An earlier attempt by The Learning Company to transfer the game to 3D (Prince of Persia 3D) was released in 1999, but despite its initial good reception failed to sell enough and the company responsible for the original trilogy was already closing doors. The game was praised for its visual design, finely tuned game mechanics and intriguing storyline, winning the game several awards. 
 
The game was developed for the PC, PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox, and later a 2D-version for the Game Boy Advance and mobile phones.

'Street Fighter II', 
'1991-02-06 00:00:00', 
'A sequel to Street Fighter, Street Fighter II improved upon the many concepts introduced in the first game, including the use of command-based special moves and a six-button configuration, while offering players a selection of multiple playable characters, each with their own unique fighting style and special moves. 
 
Street Fighter II is credited for starting the fighting game boom during the 1990s. Its success led to the production of several updated versions, each offering additional features and characters over previous versions, as well as many home versions. Some of the home versions of the Street Fighter II games have sold millions of copies, with the SNES port of the first Street Fighter II being Capcom\'s best-selling consumer game of all-time as of 2008. 
 
Street Fighter II follows several of the conventions and rules already established by its original 1987 predecessor. The player engages opponents in one-on-one close quarter combat in a series of best-two-out-of-three matches. The objective of each round is to deplete the opponent\'s vitality before the timer runs out. If both opponents knock each other out at the same time or the timer runs out with both fighters having an equal amount of vitality left, a "double KO" or "draw game" is declared and additional rounds will be played until sudden death. In the first Street Fighter II, a match could last up to ten rounds if there was no clear winner; this was reduced to four rounds in Champion Edition and onward. If there is no clear winner by the end of the final round, then either the computer-controlled opponent will win by default in a single-player match or both fighters will lose in a 2-player match. 
 
After every third match in the single player mode, the player will participate in a "bonus game" for additional points. The bonus games includes (in order) a car-breaking event; a barrel breaking bonus game where the barrels are dropped off from a conveyor belt above the player; and a drum-breaking bonus game where drums are flammable and piled over each other. The bonus games were removed from the arcade version of Super Street Fighter II Turbo. 
 
Like in the original, the game\'s controls uses a configuration of an eight-directional joystick and six attack buttons. The player uses the joystick to jump, crouch and move the character towards or away from the opponent, as well as to guard the character from an opponent\'s attacks. There are three punch buttons and three kick buttons of differing strength and speed (Light, Medium and Heavy). The player can perform a variety of basic moves in any position, including grabbing/throwing attacks, which were not featured in the original Street Fighter. Like in the original, the player can perform special moves by inputting a combination of directional and button-based commands. 
 
Street Fighter II differs from the original due to the selection of multiple playable characters, each with their distinct fighting styles and special moves. Additionally, the player can also "cancel" during animation by performing another move, allowing for a combination of several basic and special moves. Both of these features would be expanded upon in subsequent installments.',

The older brother is the stronger of the two and can pull levers or boost his younger brother to higher spaces, while the younger one can pass between narrow bars. The player progresses by manipulating the two brothers at the same time to complete various puzzles, often requiring the player to manipulate both brothers to perform differing functions (such as one distracting a hostile non-player character while the other makes their way around).

'The premise of Kingdom Hearts is designed around traveling to a collection of levels that are both original designs, and based on various Disney stories, referred to in-game as "Worlds". The Worlds are populated by NPC\'s, based on relevant characters from the corresponding Disney story, for example, the World based on Disney\'s Alice in Wonderland features appearances by Alice, the White Rabbit, and the Queen of Hearts. Interacting with these characters forms part of gameplay, while combating the games enemies, the "Heartless" forms the other. 
 
Successful completion of a World is accomplished by defeating a key foe, which is either the primary villain from the Disney story, a unique Heartless of particular strength, or a combination thereof. Each world has a key foe which must be defeated, although there are many mini-bosses, side quests and treasures to be found that contribute to character progression within the game, and give bonuses for their completion in the form of weapons, items, and bonus scenes. 
 
The game uses an experience based progression system, with experience gained by defeating foes. Experience gained rises in relation to the strength of the foe, and is consistent for each enemy over the course of the game. Levels are gained with experience, and provide increases to stat attributes in strength, defence, magic, hit points, magic points and ability points, with a new, predetermined ability unlocked approximately every four levels. Enemies also drop a combination of four types of reward upon death, green orbs that replenish HP, blue, translucent bubbles that replenish MP, yellow diamonds that contribute funds to the in-game currency "Munny", and tiny chests that when picked up, add a item to the players inventory based on the foe defeated. Such items include those used to restore HP and MP, items to aid party members or synthesis materials which can be used to create weapons and armor.',

Now players can navigate the side-scrolling worlds alone as before or invite up to three others to join them at the same time on the same level at any point in the game for competitive and cooperative multiplayer fun. With the multiplayer mode, the newest installment of the most popular video game franchise is designed to bring yet another type of family entertainment into living rooms and engage groups of friends in fast-paced Super Mario Bros. fun.

- Mario, Luigi and two Toads are all playable characters, while many others from the Mushroom Kingdom make appearances throughout the game. Players can even ride different Yoshi characters and use their tongues to swallow enemies, items and even balls of fire. 
 
- In some areas, players use the motion abilities of the Wii Remote™ controller. The first player to reach a seesaw might make it tilt to help his or her character reach a higher platform – or might make it tilt incorrectly just to mess with other players. 
 
- New items include the propeller suit, which will shoot players high into the sky with just a shake of the Wii Remote, and Mario’s new ability to transform into Penguin Mario.

Ratchet & Clank includes many of the best features of previous similar games, but makes itself unique in a number of ways. Firstly each of the game\'s levels are huge sweeping vistas with extremely detailed buildings which are visible at all times (i.e. there is no distance fog). This means that a building on the horizon is not just a "backdrop"; in all likelihood Ratchet will be exploring it in a few moments time. Secondly, the game includes a number of sub-games, such as a space fight sequence and a number of turret shoot-outs which are akin to Missile Command in the first person. 
 
The game has over twenty levels (planets) and includes as many real-time cut-scenes which tell the story. Also of note is that the story is non-linear, requiring the player to return to previous levels to complete objectives and to choose between multiple paths forward. There is also a respectable array of weapons, gadgets, and accessories to find or buy as the game progresses, which offer some unique gameplay features.',

'Until Dawn', 
'2015-08-25 00:00:00', 
'Until Dawn is an interactive drama survival horror video game. It was originally scheduled to be released on the PlayStation 3 and feature PlayStation Move support, but in August 2014, the game was reintroduced as a PlayStation 4 exclusive. 
 
Until Dawn is designed to be played multiple times, as players will miss out on quite a bit of content with a single playthrough. Each will last about nine hours in length and the game mechanics utilize a new in-game system called the "Butterfly Effect" in which any choice of action by the player may cause unforeseen consequences later on. For example, locating a weapon in an earlier chapter may allow the player to pick it up down the line when a chase scene leads back to the same room. Throughout the game, players will make difficult decisions during ethical or moral dilemmas, such as sacrificing one character to save another. The Butterfly Effect system blurs the line between right and wrong decisions and it is possible for players to keep all eight characters alive as well as having all eight of them die, allowing for many different paths and scenarios as well as offering several different endings. Until Dawn has a strict auto-save system to prevent players from reloading a previous save file to an earlier point in the game if they regret an in-game decision they have made. The only way to change the player\'s choice is to restart the game from the beginning or continue to the end and start a new game. In a developer interview, it has been said that Until Dawn has "hundreds of endings". Different endings have different variations depending on the combination of characters alive at the end of the game. 
 
The gameplay is focused on exploration, quick-time events and discovering clues as well as making decisions. There is an in-game system that will keep track of all of the clues and secrets players have discovered in total, even if there are multiple playthroughs; these clues will allow the player to piece together the mysteries of Blackwood. In terms of the gameplay mechanics and theme, Until Dawn has been noted to be similar to Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls. 
 
Until Dawn was met with a positive critical response upon release, with praise directed at the visuals, choice mechanic, horror elements, music, voice acting and gameplay design. Most of the criticism the game drew was concerning the story, mostly the second half, camera angles, character movements and partially linear plot.',

Set in the immediate aftermath of the zombie apocalypse, L4D\'s survival co-op mode lets you blast a path through the infected in four unique “movies,” guiding your survivors across the rooftops of an abandoned metropolis, through rural ghost towns and pitch-black forests in your quest to escape a devastated Ground Zero crawling with infected enemies. Each "movie" is comprised of five large maps, and can be played by one to four human players, with an emphasis on team-based strategy and objectives. 
 
New technology dubbed "the AI Director" is used to generate a unique gameplay experience every time you play. The Director tailors the frequency and ferocity of the zombie attacks to your performance, putting you in the middle of a fast-paced, but not overwhelming, Hollywood horror movie. 
 
Addictive single player, co-op, and multiplayer action gameplay from the makers of Counter-Strike and Half-Life Versus Mode lets you compete four-on-four with friends, playing as a human trying to get rescued, or as a zombie boss monster that will stop at nothing to destroy them.',

'Become the Master Assassin in an intense spy-thriller story. As Agent 47, you perform contract hits on powerful, high-profile targets in exotic locations around the world. Gameplay focuses on taking out targets in huge and intricate sandbox levels with complete freedom of approach. Where to go, when to strike and who to kill – it is all up to you. 
 
HITMAN is an expanding and evolving world of assassination. The experience began with a Prologue and Paris location in March, continued with Episode 2: Sapienza in April, Episode 3: Marrakesh in May, the Summer Bonus Episode in July, Episode 4: Bangkok in August and Episode 5: Colorado in September. The season finale in Hokkaido, Japan arrived on October 31st. 
 
HITMAN also features a major live component, which is made up of Elusive Targets, Escalation Contracts, Community-inspired Challenge Packs and Contracts Mode. 
 
An Elusive Target is the closest thing to the Hitman fantasy that we’ve ever created. These targets will be custom-created characters that are added to existing locations and are only there for a limited time in real-time. You’ll only have one chance to take them down. If they escape, they are gone for good. If you kill them, that’s the way that you killed them. There are no do-overs and no second chances. When an Elusive Target leaves the game world (one way or another) they never return. 
 
Escalation Mode is something else completely new for HITMAN and was created as a way to regularly provide a fresh challenge to players. You’ll need to master the location as well as the gameplay mechanics to complete a hit that will escalate in difficulty by adding new elements. This mode has a strong focus on having fun with the game mechanics and mixing them up. It’s more about being playful than realistic. 
 
Contracts Mode returns from Hitman Absolution; Play-to-create, mark your own targets, choose how to kill them and compete against your friends. We will also pick the best of the bunch and put them in the Featured Contracts list so you’ve got something fresh to play whenever you load up the game.',

'Legend has it that 2000 years ago in the depths of hell, a demon rebelled against the devil, waging a one-man war in support of the human world. 

In the present, Dante, a private investigator of the supernatural, realises that the devil is rallying to rise again against mankind. Deep within Dante\'s blood lies the power of ancient demons and as his power builds he transforms into a demon state where he can use his power against evil he encounters.

Commencing his battle against the demonic legions with just a sword and his twin pistols, Ebony and Ivory, Dante will soon come across more powerful weapons, such as a shotgun to aid him in his mission. However, to defeat the devil Dante must also discover special weapons possessing various elemental powers. When channelled correctly these weapons will allow Dante to call upon demonic energy and launch powerful attacks against a range of enemies.',

'Super Smash Bros. Brawl', 
'2008-01-24 00:00:00', 
'Game Overview 
 
 
The Brawl to end them all! 
 
This action-packed fighting game features a ridiculous number of characters that have appeared on Nintendo platforms, from Mario to Link to Pikachu ... to Solid Snake! As they square off in famous locales drawn from the rich history of Nintendo, literally anything can happen - and usually does. With limitless customizing options, items and weapons that boggle the mind and a wealth of modes, this game has truly infinite replayability. 
 
 
Super Smash Bros. Brawl features a sprawling adventure mode called "The Subspace Emissary" that\'s a full game in and of itself. Players jump and brawl their way through enemy-packed side-scrolling levels, meeting up with other characters, watching incredible cinematics and taking on massive bosses. 
 
 
For the first time, this celebrated series is going Wi-Fi, allowing up to four players to brawl, no matter where they may be. 
 
 
Welcome to a brawl for the ages, where anything can happen, anyone can show up and all bets are off. 
 
Game storyline: 
In multiplayer games, characters from all Nintendo universes meet up in Nintendo locales to duke it out. In the solo mode called "The Subspace Emissary," the world of Smash Bros. is invaded by an entity called the Ancient Minister and his army of creatures, called "The Primid." Normally, characters come alive in the world of Smash Bros. to do battle, then turn back into trophies when defeated. However, the Ancient Minister starts turning characters into trophies to harness their power, then detonates bombs that suck pieces of the world back into his realm of Subspace. Eventually, all the characters must work together to defeat the invading creatures from Subspace - this is accomplished by playing through side-scrolling levels. 
 
 
How to progress through the game: 
For multiplayer games, players pick characters, set rules and locations for where they want to play and then duke it out. In Solo Mode, characters play through a long, side-scrolling adventure, beating up enemies along the way as they watch short cinematics starring their favorite characters. 
 
 
Characters: 
Mario, Samus, Bowser, Donkey Kong, Solid Snake, Meta Knight, Kirby, Pikachu, Zero Suit Samus, Link, Zelda, Pit and Wario, to name just a few. Anyone and anything from a Nintendo universe could appear in this game in one form or another. 
 
 
Special powers/weapons/moves/features: 
Anything from a Nintendo game could conceivably be in this game, whether it\'s a musical score, an obscure item or a character that shows up to help the fighters. Super Smash Bros. Brawl is eminently customizable, so players can choose the frequency of items appearing, adjust musical scores and basically play the game however they\'d like. Items range from baseball bats to proximity mines to Poké Balls to Assist Trophies, which spawn characters like Hammer Bros. and Sim City\'s Dr. Wright to attack others.',

The game takes place in the 60-year gap between the events of Tolkien\'s The Hobbit and The Lord of The Rings. It is a story of revenge, slaughter, and mystery set entirely in Mordor, the Land of Shadows. At its center is Talion, an ordinary man who loses everything, including his mortal life. 
 
The game is set in a fully open world, and features various role-playing game elements such as experience points and skills. There are various ways the player can complete their main objective. Aside from the main storyline, there are various side quests and random events the player can complete within Mordor. 
 
The melee system is inspired by that of the Batman Arkham series. Getting into a good fighting rhythm, using both regular attacks and counter-attacks will improve the player\'s combo multiplier. 
 
A unique feature of Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is the Nemesis system. Every enemy in the game has their own name, rank, and memory. These enemies will continue to do their own jobs and tasks even when they\'re off screen. If the player does not kill an enemy in an encounter, this enemy will remember the player and change their tactics and conversations based on the encounter.',

This region is inhabited by various Pokémon, and unlike before, none of those available prior to Generation V can be obtained before completing the main story by defeating Team Plasma.
The games\' names were revealed on the official Japanese Pokémon website on April 9, 2010, and scans from the subsequent issue of the magazine leaked the following day, April 10.
Pokémon Black and White are followed in 2012 by two sequels, Pokémon Black 2 and White 2, which are set two years after the events of Black and White. Black 2 and White 2 are the second and final paired versions of Generation V.',

With the enhanced remake Pokémon Platinum, the games comprise the fifth installment and fourth generation of the Pokémon series of RPGs. First released in Japan on September 28, 2006, the games were later released to North America, Australia, and Europe over the course of 2007.

Like previous Pokémon games, Diamond and Pearl chronicle the adventures of a young Pokémon trainer as he/she trains and battles Pokémon while also thwarting the schemes of a criminal organization. The games add many new features, such as Internet play over the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection and changes to battle mechanics and Pokémon Contests, along with addition of 107 new Pokémon. The games are independent of each other but feature largely the same plot and while both can be played separately, it is necessary to trade between them in order to complete the games\' Pokédexes.',

The player controls Pac-Man through a maze, eating pac-dots (also called pellets or just dots). When all pac-dots are eaten, Pac-Man is taken to the next stage. Four enemies (Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde) roam the maze, trying to catch Pac-Man. If an enemy touches Pac-Man, a life is lost and the Pac-Man itself withers and dies. When all lives have been lost, the game ends. Near the corners of the maze are four larger, flashing dots known as power pellets that provide Pac-Man with the temporary ability to eat the enemies. The enemies turn deep blue, reverse direction and usually move more slowly. When an enemy is eaten, its eyes remain and return to the center box where it is regenerated in its normal color. Blue enemies flash white to signal that they are about to become dangerous again and the length of time for which the enemies remain vulnerable varies from one stage to the next, generally becoming shorter as the game progresses.',

These prize bubbles come in two types, small ones which constitute points and larger ones that contain new costumes, stickers or other type of collectibles that can be used to customise Sackboy or in level creation.

Many months have passed since the events of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, and Link, Tetra and Tetra’s band of pirates have set sail in search of new lands. They come across a patch of ocean covered in a dense fog, in which they discover an abandoned ship. Tetra falls into danger when she explores the ship alone, and Link falls into the ocean when he attempts to rescue her. When he washes up unconscious on the shores of a mysterious island, he is awakened by the sound of a fairy’s voice. With the aid of this fairy, he sets off to find Tetra – and his way back to the seas he once knew.

The player is rated at the end of each level, primarily dependent on the gruesomeness of the killings and the speed of completion, from one (unimpressive) to five (extremely competent) stars. Executions are preferred in order to gain a higher score, thus encouraging players to play as viscerally as possible.

Mad Max will feature a variety of weapons which Max can use to defeat enemies. Though the shotgun is Max\'s weapon of choice, ammo is scarce, and so melee options are the smarter way to go. The \'thunderstick\' is an explosive weapon that can be lanced into an enemy\'s chest, crackling like a lit dynamite fuse before blowing the victim to smithereens. The Harpoon is also one of Max\'s favorite weapon though it can only be used in-vehicle with Chum riding along. Max\'s Magnum Opus can be combined with a speedy V12 engine and powerful ramming ability to destroy enemies\'s vehicles and weaponry. When simultaneously driving and aiming, the game enters slow-motion and allows you to toggle between targets. Not much is known about the vehicular combat and its features. 
 
Mad Max will feature crafting system which can be used to craft new weapons and tools. Max\'s garage can also be used to change and modify the car\'s engines, chassis, wheels, body works including paint treatment and the “shell” of the auto-mobile and the car’s weight and attributes update accordingly. Max can also be upgraded though it\'s plans hasn\'t fully been implemented. 
 
Many choices are given in the game, such as, either playing silently or aggressively. Max can also get guidance from Chum about how he can complete his objectives strategically. However, its largely up to the player how he can complete the objectives.',
